League of Legends Django Web Application

This was a project I worked on in order to get used to calling a REST API and using the django web framework.
In this project I use the official Riot Games API at developer.riotgames.com.

I use the python requests package in order to make calls to grab information from the API. All of the css and styling
was done myself from scratch. I am working on getting a working version on my personal website at www.jonahmin.com.
